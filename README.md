# Russian-Roulette-Super-Simple
It's a simple two-player Russian roulette game where the trigger is pulled via the mouse's left click.
Pygame is used for the UI and overall mechanism, and Numpy is used for generating a variable of random integer value between 0 and 5 to simulate the odds of the real Russian roulette game.
